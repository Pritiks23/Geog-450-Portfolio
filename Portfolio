Project 1: Yelp API Crawler 
Intro: I used an API crawler to filter bars in Redmond, Washington. As there is a cultural significance to it, and Redmond being a rich diverse area it made sense to me
to explore the local bar scene and see how much agglomeration due to location influences other bars in the city. These charts show the big 
impact bars play on the economy. The variety of bars give a vibrant community for different parts of Redmond. The radial dendrogram shows 
the relationships: how closely similar bars are. Many bars would have a diverse clientele: rating/reviews would reflect this. As
Seattle/Redmond is home to an array of Pacific Islanders,Asian,Latino,African,and Native American people so having a variety of bars
which each has some sort of cultural tradition shows how the community is reflecting a more open approach embracing different cultures. Location: https://www.mapquest.com/us/washington/redmond-wa-282039142

Project 2 Foreign Born Population Sankey Diagram in King County:
In this Python project I created an Infographic with a Sankey Diagram shows us the countries with the most immigrants migrating to King County where I manipulated
data from the Census Bureau.Click on each country to see how the number of people who were born in that country and move to King County. Location: https://kingcounty.gov/en/legacy/about/region/maps

Project 3 Image Processing:
I took thirty photos in Seattle specifically the IMA, and did some python image processing PIL and eetrieved those color values and
the number of pixels occupied by the color in the image.
I converted the color value in hex and mapped a percentage of a color occupied area instead of the pixel number to compare the images properly. I then did normalized the values
and did some analysis of what the results say about Seattle. Location: https://www.mapquest.com/search/University%20of%20washington%20Seattle
